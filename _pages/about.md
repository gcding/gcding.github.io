I'm Ding Guanchen(丁冠辰), a third-year master student at [WHU Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision](http://iip.whu.edu.cn/) (expect to graduate in 2023) , Wuhan, China, advised by [Prof. Zhenzhong Chen](http://iip.whu.edu.cn/~zzchen/index.html). 

**Research:** I mainly work on designing algorithms to address key problems in Crowd/Object counting and Action/Abnormal detection/recognition, such as scale variation in counting, domain gaps in different data sets and abnormal detection in complex scenarios. Now I'm working on Image / Video Processing under the joint supervise of [Prof. Changwen Chen](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~chencw/Home.html).

**Previously:** I did my bachelor at [school of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/) and my minor degree at [school of Economics and Management, Wuhan University](http://ems.whu.edu.cn/).
