I'm Ding Guanchen (丁冠辰), a first-year phd student at the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by [Prof. Changwen Chen](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-chen-changwen/).

**Research:** Now I'm working to solve some key problems in communication systems. I also have some experiments in crowd/object counting, action/abnormal detection/recognition and remote sensing image analysis. If you are interested in working with me on related topics, please feel free to connect me via email.

**Previously:** I did my Master and Bachelor Degree at [school of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zhenzhong Chen](http://iip.whu.edu.cn/~zzchen/index.html). I obtained my minor degree at [school of Economics and Management, Wuhan University](http://ems.whu.edu.cn/).
